Below is **PART-3: Views and URLs**, one of the **most frequently asked Django interview areas**.
This section is written exactly how interviewers expect answers — **clear, layered, and scenario-based**.

---

# 🟢 PART-3: DJANGO VIEWS & URLS (INTERVIEW Q&A)

---

## 1️⃣ What are Views in Django?

---

## 🔰 Beginner Level

### Q1️⃣ What is a view in Django?

### ✅ Answer

A **view** in Django is a **Python function or class** that:

* Receives an HTTP request
* Contains business logic
* Returns an HTTP response (HTML, JSON, etc.)

Views act as the **brain of a Django application**.

---

### 📌 Multi-line Explanation

When a user hits a URL:

1. Django matches the URL in `urls.py`
2. Calls the corresponding view
3. View processes data
4. Returns a response to the browser

---

### 🌍 Real-time Example

User opens:

```
/students/
```

Django:

* Calls `student_list` view
* Fetches data from DB
* Sends HTML response

---

### 🔁 Follow-up Questions & Answers

**Q: Can a view return JSON instead of HTML?**
✅ Yes, views can return JSON, text, redirects, or HTML.

---

**Q: Where are views defined?**
✅ Inside `views.py` of an app.

---

### 🔀 Cross-Questions & Answers

**Q: Can one URL map to multiple views?**
❌ No, one URL maps to only one view.

---

**Q: What happens if a view does not return a response?**
❌ Django throws an error (`ValueError: View didn't return an HttpResponse`).

---

---

## 2️⃣ What are Function-Based Views (FBVs)?

---

## 🔰 Beginner Level

### Q2️⃣ What is a Function-Based View?

### ✅ Answer

A **Function-Based View (FBV)** is a **Python function** that takes an HTTP request as input and returns an HTTP response.

---

### 📌 Multi-line Explanation

FBVs:

* Are simple and readable
* Best for small or straightforward logic
* Use decorators for extra behavior

---

### 🌍 Real-time Example (FBV)

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("Welcome to Django")
```

---

### 🔁 Follow-up Questions & Answers

**Q: What is the mandatory argument in an FBV?**
✅ `request`

---

**Q: Can FBVs handle GET and POST requests?**
✅ Yes, using `request.method`.

```python
if request.method == "POST":
    ...
```

---

### 🔀 Cross-Questions & Answers

**Q: Can we use decorators with FBVs?**
✅ Yes (e.g., `@login_required`).

---

**Q: Are FBVs slower than CBVs?**
❌ No, performance difference is negligible.

---

---

## 3️⃣ How does URL Routing work in Django?

---

## 🔰 Beginner Level

### Q3️⃣ What is URL routing?

### ✅ Answer

URL routing maps **URL patterns to views** using `urls.py`.

---

### 📌 Multi-line Explanation

Django uses:

* `path()` or `re_path()`
* Matches URLs top-to-bottom
* Calls the matched view

---

### 🌍 Real-time Example

```python
# urls.py
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('home/', views.home),
]
```

Accessing `/home/` triggers `home()` view.

---

### 🔁 Follow-up Questions & Answers

**Q: What happens if URL is not matched?**
❌ Django returns **404 Not Found**.

---

**Q: Can we pass data through URLs?**
✅ Yes, using URL parameters.

```python
path('student/<int:id>/', views.student_detail)
```

---

### 🔀 Cross-Questions & Answers

**Q: Difference between `path()` and `re_path()`?**

* `path()` → simpler, readable
* `re_path()` → regex-based routing

---

**Q: What is `include()` used for?**
✅ To include app-level URLs into project-level URLs.

---

---

## 4️⃣ What is Template Rendering in Django?

---

## 🔰 Beginner Level

### Q4️⃣ What is a template in Django?

### ✅ Answer

A **template** is an HTML file used to display dynamic data using Django Template Language (DTL).

---

### 📌 Multi-line Explanation

Templates:

* Separate UI from logic
* Use placeholders (`{{ }}`)
* Use template tags (`{% %}`)

---

### 🌍 Real-time Example

**View**

```python
def profile(request):
    return render(request, 'profile.html', {'name': 'Eswar'})
```

**Template**

```html
<h1>Welcome {{ name }}</h1>
```

---

### 🔁 Follow-up Questions & Answers

**Q: What is `render()` function?**
✅ Combines template + context data + request.

---

**Q: Where are templates stored?**
✅ Inside `templates/` directory.

---

### 🔀 Cross-Questions & Answers

**Q: Can templates execute Python code?**
❌ No, only limited logic is allowed.

---

**Q: What happens if template file is missing?**
❌ Django raises `TemplateDoesNotExist`.

---

---

## 🔵 Intermediate Level Questions

---

### Q5️⃣ How do you handle dynamic URLs?

```python
path('product/<slug:name>/', views.product_detail)
```

✅ Used to pass values dynamically to views.

---

### Q6️⃣ How do views communicate with templates?

✅ Through **context dictionaries**.

---

### Q7️⃣ What is namespacing in URLs?

✅ Prevents URL name conflicts using `app_name`.

---

---

## 🔴 Advanced Level Questions

---

### Q8️⃣ What is the request-response lifecycle in Django?

1. Request → URL Resolver
2. View execution
3. Template rendering
4. Response sent to client

---

### Q9️⃣ How do you optimize views?

* Use ORM optimization
* Use caching
* Avoid heavy logic in templates

---

### Q🔟 FBV vs CBV – which is better?

* FBV → Simple logic
* CBV → Reusable, scalable

---
