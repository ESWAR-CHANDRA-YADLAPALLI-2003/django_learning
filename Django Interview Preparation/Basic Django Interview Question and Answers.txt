# 🟢 PART-1: DJANGO BASICS (WITH FULL FOLLOW-UP & CROSS ANSWERS)

---

## 1️⃣ What is Django?

### 🔰 Main Answer (Recap)

Django is a **high-level Python web framework** used to build **secure, scalable, and maintainable** web applications quickly.
It follows **MVT architecture** and provides **built-in features** like ORM, admin panel, authentication, and security.

---

### 🔁 Follow-up Questions — WITH ANSWERS

#### Q1️⃣ Is Django suitable for small projects?

✅ **Yes**, Django can be used for small projects.
Although it has many built-in features, we can use only what we need.

📌 Example:
A simple blog or CRUD app can still benefit from Django ORM and admin panel.

---

#### Q2️⃣ Is Django good for APIs only?

✅ Yes. Using **Django REST Framework (DRF)**, Django is widely used for **API-only backends**.

📌 Example:
Frontend (React/Angular) → Backend (Django REST API)

---

#### Q3️⃣ Can Django be used with frontend frameworks?

✅ Yes. Django is often used as a **backend API** with:

* React
* Angular
* Vue

---

### 🔀 Cross-Questions — WITH ANSWERS

#### Q4️⃣ What does “batteries-included” mean?

It means Django provides **ready-made solutions** like:

* Authentication
* Admin panel
* ORM
* Security

So developers don’t need to install many third-party packages.

---

#### Q5️⃣ What are Django’s limitations?

* Slightly heavy for very small apps
* Steeper learning curve than Flask
* Less flexible compared to micro frameworks

---

#### Q6️⃣ Is Django synchronous or asynchronous?

Originally **synchronous**, but from Django 3+:

* Supports **async views**
* Uses **ASGI** for async handling

---

---

## 2️⃣ Why Django over Flask?

### 🔰 Main Answer (Recap)

Django is preferred for **large, complex, and scalable applications**, while Flask is better for **small or lightweight apps**.

---

### 🔁 Follow-up Questions — WITH ANSWERS

#### Q1️⃣ Can Flask scale like Django?

Yes, Flask can scale, but:

* Requires **manual configuration**
* Needs third-party tools

Django scales faster due to built-in features.

---

#### Q2️⃣ Can we build REST APIs using Django?

Yes. With **Django REST Framework**, Django is one of the most popular API frameworks.

---

#### Q3️⃣ Which is faster: Flask or Django?

* Flask is faster for **very small apps**
* Django performs better in **large systems** due to optimized architecture

---

### 🔀 Cross-Questions — WITH ANSWERS

#### Q4️⃣ When would you choose Flask over Django?

* Simple APIs
* Prototypes
* Microservices

---

#### Q5️⃣ Is Django too heavy for small apps?

Not really. Django can be modular; unused components don’t affect performance much.

---

#### Q6️⃣ Can Django be modular like Flask?

Yes. Django apps are **loosely coupled and reusable**.

---

---

## 3️⃣ Explain Django MVT Architecture

### 🔰 Main Answer (Recap)

MVT stands for:

Context is a **dictionary** passed from view to template.

```python
return render(request, "page.html", {"name": "Eswar"})
```

---

### 🔀 Cross-Questions — WITH ANSWERS

#### Q4️⃣ Difference between FBV and CBV?

* FBV → Simple, function-based
* CBV → Reusable, object-oriented

---

#### Q5️⃣ Can templates call Python functions?

❌ No.
Templates are **logic-limited** to maintain separation of concerns.

---

#### Q6️⃣ What happens if template is missing?

Django raises:

```
TemplateDoesNotExist
```

---

---

## 4️⃣ Project vs App in Django

### 🔰 Main Answer (Recap)

    ├── urls.py
    ├── asgi.py
    └── wsgi.py
```

---

### 🌍 Real-time Example

In a company project:

* Project = **overall backend system**
* Apps = modules inside it (users, products, payments)

---

### 🔁 Follow-up Questions & Answers

#### Q: What is the role of `manage.py`?

✅ It acts as a command-line utility to run Django commands.

---

#### Q: Can project name and folder name be different?

```bash
django-admin startproject config .
```

---

### 🔀 Cross-Questions & Answers
