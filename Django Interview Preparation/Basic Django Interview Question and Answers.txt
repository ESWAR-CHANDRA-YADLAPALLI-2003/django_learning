# 🟢 PART-1: DJANGO BASICS (WITH FULL FOLLOW-UP & CROSS ANSWERS)

---

## 1️⃣ What is Django?

### 🔰 Main Answer (Recap)

Django is a **high-level Python web framework** used to build **secure, scalable, and maintainable** web applications quickly.
It follows **MVT architecture** and provides **built-in features** like ORM, admin panel, authentication, and security.

---

### 🔁 Follow-up Questions — WITH ANSWERS

#### Q1️⃣ Is Django suitable for small projects?

✅ **Yes**, Django can be used for small projects.
Although it has many built-in features, we can use only what we need.

📌 Example:
A simple blog or CRUD app can still benefit from Django ORM and admin panel.

---

#### Q2️⃣ Is Django good for APIs only?

✅ Yes. Using **Django REST Framework (DRF)**, Django is widely used for **API-only backends**.

📌 Example:
Frontend (React/Angular) → Backend (Django REST API)

---

#### Q3️⃣ Can Django be used with frontend frameworks?

✅ Yes. Django is often used as a **backend API** with:

* React
* Angular
* Vue

---

### 🔀 Cross-Questions — WITH ANSWERS

#### Q4️⃣ What does “batteries-included” mean?

It means Django provides **ready-made solutions** like:

* Authentication
* Admin panel
* ORM
* Security

So developers don’t need to install many third-party packages.

---

#### Q5️⃣ What are Django’s limitations?

* Slightly heavy for very small apps
* Steeper learning curve than Flask
* Less flexible compared to micro frameworks

---

#### Q6️⃣ Is Django synchronous or asynchronous?

Originally **synchronous**, but from Django 3+:

* Supports **async views**
* Uses **ASGI** for async handling

---

---

## 2️⃣ Why Django over Flask?

### 🔰 Main Answer (Recap)

Django is preferred for **large, complex, and scalable applications**, while Flask is better for **small or lightweight apps**.

---

### 🔁 Follow-up Questions — WITH ANSWERS

#### Q1️⃣ Can Flask scale like Django?

Yes, Flask can scale, but:

* Requires **manual configuration**
* Needs third-party tools

Django scales faster due to built-in features.

---

#### Q2️⃣ Can we build REST APIs using Django?

Yes. With **Django REST Framework**, Django is one of the most popular API frameworks.

---

#### Q3️⃣ Which is faster: Flask or Django?

* Flask is faster for **very small apps**
* Django performs better in **large systems** due to optimized architecture

---

### 🔀 Cross-Questions — WITH ANSWERS

#### Q4️⃣ When would you choose Flask over Django?

* Simple APIs
* Prototypes
* Microservices

---

#### Q5️⃣ Is Django too heavy for small apps?

Not really. Django can be modular; unused components don’t affect performance much.

---

#### Q6️⃣ Can Django be modular like Flask?

Yes. Django apps are **loosely coupled and reusable**.

---

---

## 3️⃣ Explain Django MVT Architecture

### 🔰 Main Answer (Recap)

MVT stands for:

* **Model** → Data layer
* **View** → Business logic
* **Template** → UI

---

### 🔁 Follow-up Questions — WITH ANSWERS

#### Q1️⃣ Where is Controller in Django?

Django handles controller logic internally via:

* URL dispatcher
* Framework core

---

#### Q2️⃣ Can views return JSON?

Yes. Views can return:

* HTML
* JSON
* HTTP responses

📌 Example:

```python
return JsonResponse({"status": "success"})
```

---

#### Q3️⃣ What is Template Context?

Context is a **dictionary** passed from view to template.

```python
return render(request, "page.html", {"name": "Eswar"})
```

---

### 🔀 Cross-Questions — WITH ANSWERS

#### Q4️⃣ Difference between FBV and CBV?

* FBV → Simple, function-based
* CBV → Reusable, object-oriented

---

#### Q5️⃣ Can templates call Python functions?

❌ No.
Templates are **logic-limited** to maintain separation of concerns.

---

#### Q6️⃣ What happens if template is missing?

Django raises:

```
TemplateDoesNotExist
```

---

---

## 4️⃣ Project vs App in Django

### 🔰 Main Answer (Recap)

* **Project** → Entire configuration
* **App** → Functional module

---

### 🔁 Follow-up Questions — WITH ANSWERS

#### Q1️⃣ Can one app be used in multiple projects?

✅ Yes. Django apps are **reusable**.

---

#### Q2️⃣ Is app mandatory in Django?

Technically no, but **best practice** is to use apps for modularity.

---

#### Q3️⃣ Can we create custom apps?

Yes, using:

```bash
python manage.py startapp appname
```

---

### 🔀 Cross-Questions — WITH ANSWERS

#### Q4️⃣ Difference between INSTALLED_APPS and apps folder?

* apps folder → Code
* INSTALLED_APPS → Activation/configuration

---

#### Q5️⃣ What happens if app is not added to settings?

* Models won’t migrate
* App features won’t work

---

#### Q6️⃣ How many apps can a project have?

Unlimited, as long as system resources allow.

---

---

## 5️⃣ Django Folder Structure & Key Files

### 🔰 Main Answer (Recap)

Django provides a structured project layout to manage configuration, routing, and execution.

Django throws errors like:

* ImproperlyConfigured
* Database connection errors

---

#### Q2️⃣ Difference between WSGI and ASGI?

| WSGI        | ASGI          |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| Synchronous | Async support |
| Traditional | Modern        |

---

#### Q3️⃣ Where do we configure database?

In `settings.py` → `DATABASES`

---

### 🔀 Cross-Questions — WITH ANSWERS
